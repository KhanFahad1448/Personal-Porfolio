# Overview

This is a personal portfolio website built from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
The portfolio showcases all my projects in a clean and interactive layout inspired by Figma designs.
I used Matter.js to add engaging physics-based animations, making the portfolio visually dynamic.

The contact form is integrated with Firebase, allowing real-time submissions and data management, similar to Netlify forms.
This portfolio is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
